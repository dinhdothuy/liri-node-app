# liri-node-app
LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data.
LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

*** What Each Command Should Do:

---------------------------------------------------

node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>

This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API 
("https://rest.bandsintown.com/artists/" + artist + "/events?app_id=codingbootcamp") 
for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:

          * Name of the venue

          * Venue location

          * Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")
    
---------------------------------------------------

node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'

This will show the following information about the song in user terminal/bash window

          * Artist(s)

          * The song's name

          * A preview link of the song from Spotify

          * The album that the song is from

If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

We utilized the node-spotify-api package in order to retrieve song information from the Spotify API.

The Spotify API requires signing up as a developer to generate the necessary credentials. 
We can follow these steps in order to generate a client id and client secret:

    Step One: Visit https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/

    Step Two: Either login to your existing Spotify account or create a new one (a free account is fine) and log in.

    Step Three: Once logged in, navigate to https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create 
    to register a new application to be used with the Spotify API. We can fill in whatever you'd like for these fields. 
    When finished, click the "complete" button.

    Step Four: On the next screen, scroll down to see client id and client secret. 
    Copy these values down somewhere, we'll need them to use the Spotify API and the node-spotify-api package.

node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'

This will output the following information to user terminal/bash window:

            * Title of the movie.
            * Year the movie came out.
            * IMDB Rating of the movie.
            * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
            * Country where the movie was produced.
            * Language of the movie.
            * Plot of the movie.
            * Actors in the movie.
            
If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'

We used the axios package to retrieve data from the OMDB API. 
Like all of the in-class activities, the OMDB API requires an API key. Developers may use trilogy.

--------------------------------------------------------

node liri.js do-what-it-says

Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

It should run spotify-this-song for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in random.txt.

Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this:

          concert-this,Cher
          movie-this,"Kung Fu Panda 3"
          spotify-this-song,"I Want it That Way"

--------------------------------------------------------

BONUS
In addition to logging the data to user terminal/bash window, output the data to a .txt file called log.txt.

We can append each command the user run to the log.txt file.

It does not overwrite the file each time we run a command.
